<h3>
	How does the radiative feedback from massive stars regulate star formation in molecular clouds?
</h3>

Massive stars emit strong radiation in various bands, which are absorbed by the gas and dust that surrounds them in molecular clouds. This can impart energy and momentum to the gas/dust system, which can heat the gas and provide momentum support against gravitational collapse. 

<h3>
	Can feedback drive turbulence in molecular clouds? How does this dynamically affect the evolution of the clouds?

	How is star formation spatially distributed in galaxies, and what physics controls this?
