<h3><u>
	Radiation Pressure in Regulating Star Formation and Driving Winds in Star Clusters
</u> </h3>
Radiation pressure on dust grains is an important feedback mechanism in the ISM. In star-forming regions, dust grains absorb the energy and momentum in ultraviolet (UV) photons from massive stars, and via collisions with gas particles impart this energy and momentum to the gas. The energy input can heat the gas and supress fragmentation, and the radiation pressure can act as a support against gravitational collapse, and possibly drive outflows if sufficiently strong. In addition, dust grains re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared (IR) wavelengths, which, in extreme environments such as super-star cluster forming environments in starbursts (e.g. NGC 253), can be optically thick and itself provide momentum support to the star-forming cloud -- sometimes significantly greater than that available in the UV photons. 

In Menon, Federrath & Krumholz 2022a, we tested the role of the momentum available in the dust-reprocessed IR photons in regulating star formation in super-star cluster forming environments with our recently developed novel radiation hydrodynamics scheme VETTAM (see below). We found that the radiation pressure from IR photons is unable to provide support against gravitional collapse, unlike the predictions of some semi-analytic models. This is primarily due to the fact that the dust opacities in the IR are not sufficiently high for radiation forces to compete against gravity, even in extremely dense conditions. It is only in conditions where the dust abundances are higher (~ 3 times the solar value) and/or the IMF is top-heavy that IR radiation pressure can play a dynamical role in star cluster formation, and even there the escape of radiation through optically thin channels lowers the efficiency of the mechanism.
