<h3><u>
	Interplay of Turbulence and Feedback in the ISM 
</u> </h3>

Massive stars emit strong radiation in various bands, which are absorbed by the gas and dust that surrounds them in molecular clouds. This can impart energy and momentum to the gas/dust system, which can heat the gas and provide momentum support against gravitational collapse.
