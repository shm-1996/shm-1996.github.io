Hi there! I'm an Astrophysics PhD Student working with [**A/Prof. Christoph Federrath**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/) and [**Prof. Mark Krumholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. 


My research focuses on studying the formation of stars in the Interstellar Medium, and how the feedback from newly-formed stars can regulate this process and affect the evolution of galaxies. This requires unraveling the compex interplay of the multiple physical mechanisms involved in this process, and the use of numerical methods to solve the resulting physical equations. I primarily develop and use a combination of theoretical models, and numerical simulations run on powerful supercomputers, to probe these scientific questions. I also endavour to compare my theoretical insights with observations to constrain and test models.

To know more about my research please head to the [**Research**][1] tab or take a look at my [**Resume**][2].
