Hi there! I'm an Astrophysics PhD Student working with <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/" style="color:#F5D3B8;"> A/Prof Christoph Federrath </a> and <a href="https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/" style="color:#F5D3B8;"> Prof. Mark Krumholz </a> at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. ![image-right](/assets/images/Shyam_Photo.jpg){: .align-right}

My research focuses on studying the dynamics of the environment in which stars form also known as the Interstellar Medium (or ISM). I study how stars form from this interstellar environment, and how the radiation of newly-formed stars can in turn alter this environment, effectively resulting in a coupled complex system to study. This is studied using a combination of simple theoretical models and complex numerical simulations run on powerful supercomputers.

To know more about my research please head to the [Research][1] tab or take a look at my [Resume][2].
