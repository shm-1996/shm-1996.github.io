Hi there! I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow Fellow currently based at the [**Centre for Computational Astrophysics (CCA), Flatiron Institute**](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/). I primarily work with the Galaxy Formation group at the CCA and with [**Prof. Blakesley Burkhart's**](https://www.bburkhart.com) group at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Astrophysics in the other hemisphere, working with [**A/Prof. Christoph Federrath**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~chfeder/) and [**Prof. Mark Krumholz**](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/) at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australian National University (ANU). I am originally from the coastal city of Kochi, Kerala in the diverse nation of India. 


My research focuses on studying the formation of stars in the Interstellar Medium, and how the feedback from newly-formed stars can regulate this process and affect the evolution of galaxies. More recently, my work has focused on how these processes plays out in conditions resembling the early Universe, and its implications on exciting new observations facilitated by the James Webb Space Telescope. This requires unraveling the compex interplay of the multiple physical mechanisms involved in this process, and the use of numerical methods to solve the resulting physical equations. To this end, I am involved in developing, and using, a combination of theoretical models and numerical simulations run on powerful supercomputers, to probe these scientific questions. 

To know more about my research please head to the [**Research**][1] tab or take a look at my [**Resume**][2].
