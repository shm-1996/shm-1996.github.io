<h3><u>
  Gas Evolution
</u> </h3>

Simulations from [Menon, Federrath & Krumholz 2022b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220614190M/abstract) showing the evolution of the projected gas density under the effects of UV+IR radiation pressure, for four different initial gas surface densities (increasing top-left to bottom-right).

<h3><u>
  UV vs IR
</u> </h3>

Comparing the evolution of gas for control simulations with only the radiation pressure in the IR band (left), UV band (middle), and the combined UV and IR radiation bands (right).
